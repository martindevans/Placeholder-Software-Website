	<b>Game Artist</b>

	<p>We are looking for a talented digital artist to join our team, working on developing a 2D puzzler platformer. You would be expected to produce both character and level assets for the game, however we'd love for our artist to actively contribute to the design and direction of the whole project.</p>

	Responsibilities:
	<ul>
		<li>Take a lead on developing an artistic style for the game</li>
		<li>Produce concept art</li>
		<li>Draw level art, working from a description of the setting of the level and a schematic</li>
		<li>Design and draw unique characters and assets for the game</li>
		<li>Attend short weekly online progress meetings</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You would not be required to produce animations for the characters, however close collaboration with our animator will be essential - we are using a limb-based animation system.</p>

	<p>The game is currently being developed by three people, responsible for level design, programming and animation. We aim to have the game complete for a simultaneous xbox and PC release. The team are all working on a profit share basis and thus our artist would need to do so as well.</p>

	<p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@placeholder-software.co.uk">admin@placeholder-software.co.uk</a> if you are interested in joining the team and want to know more about the project.</p>
